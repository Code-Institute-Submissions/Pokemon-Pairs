# Testing

Testing has been taking place throughout the project. 
I have used a combination of Jasmine Testing, bug fixes and a final project check. 

### Bugs

I have been testing bugs throughout the project. I kept a lot of commit which detailed the bug and the fix.
Please find a full list here:- [Link to bugs page](assets/files/README-bugList.md)  


### Jasmine Testing

The jasmine tests are available on the repository. They focus on the output of specific functions.
